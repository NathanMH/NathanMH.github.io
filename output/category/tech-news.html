</ol>
<p><a id="org18a9cdf"></a></p>
<h1>Human Nature</h1>
<p>To preface this, I will say that I don't have a psychology degree, social science degree or any formal education of any relevance. I do however, like many youth of my generation, have extensive experience with the current suite of social media platforms such as FaceBook, Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, Snapchat, etc.</p>
<p>Having just read a few articles (1,[<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds</a>] 2, 3) on confirmation bias and the like, it occurred to me that even if people are able to recognize an echo chamber, they may not know how to escape it, or why they should want to.</p>
<p>Some of the relevant cognitive biases which apply here include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirmation Bias</li>
<li>Belief Bias</li>
<li>In-Group Bias</li>
<li>Framing Effect</li>
<li>Anchoring</li>
<li>Dunning-Kruger Effect</li>
</ol>
<p>I won't go into detail about each of these (mainly because I don't understand them enough to give a proper explanation) and remember that this list is not exhaustive, there can be many other factors in digital consumption.</p>
<p><a id="org68c0321"></a></p>
<h1>Recognizing An Echo Chamber</h1>
<p>Sometimes it can be difficult to define when a medium transforms from a balanced culture to an echo chamber, particularly if it becomes biased in a way that aligns with your own opinions. This is because everyone enjoys having confirmation in their beliefs. It is easier to accept a falsehood than to admit a personal misconception. That's why it is important to strive for self improvement, especially when it is difficult.</p>
<p><a id="orgf09591e"></a></p>
<h1>FaceBook</h1>
<p>Facebook is an interesting case, since your experience is fundamentally based on your immediate social bubble. Facebook started out only at Harvard, but quickly encompassed most colleges and universities. The way a friends list is built up was entirely based upon where you went to school, which is a very particular bubble. Unfortunately it is difficult expand your friends list with contrarian views on purpose. There is no doubt that Facebook employs algorithms to maximize showing you content that you will click on. Whether this comes in the form of pictures, articles, or quizzes, it is important to try your best to click on those links from friends that you do not necessarily see eye to eye with. Unfortunately this does require these posts are from valid sources.</p>
<p><a id="org6153aea"></a></p>
<h1>Reddit</h1>
<p>NOTE: Just reading headlines is an issue that permeates the site influencing what posts are most viewed, often described as clickbait.</p>
<p>This is the platform that I am most familiar with, and has some of the most entrenched bubbles. With an archaic voting system, powerful self-appointed moderators, and a formerly heavily tech influenced audience, it is no wonder that many subreddits quickly turn into echo-chambers. Where some subreddits claim to be free from bias, the voting system, while not intended to hide dissenting opinions, often works in favour of what is commonly labelled 'the hive mind'. If you've spent any time on Reddit, then you know that the user base is quite disparate at times ranging from the average (/r/hockey) to ugly (/r/incels). Each of these subreddits have quite strict rules which are enforced by moderators. The problem here is that where one is a general purpose gathering of people with a similar interest, the other is an echo chamber where dissenting opinions are silenced. With the subscription system, it is easy to login to an account on reddit and fill up your frontpage with subreddits of ideas that you agree with.</p>
<p><a id="org19ee44a"></a></p>
<h1>Twitter</h1>
<p>An interesting study showed the lack of crossover between political ideologies in the Twitterverse. Not only were people of differing opinions not interacting, they were not even aware of each other for the most part.</p>
<p><a id="org0598fa2"></a></p>
<h1>How to Escape</h1>
<p>Large corporations have gained incredible abilities to influence your web experience, particularly with social media. Almost every site that you visit will collect any data from you that they can whether it is info on the links you click, or the site that directed you there. With a history on it's users, a site can tailor information to better influence your behaviour.</p>
<p>The best medicine for an echo chamber is knowledge. Understanding that you are only receiving half of any given story is an important step. The second step of actively choosing to listen to ideas that conflict with your worldview is much more difficult. In some ways it seems similar to the well known stages of grief:</p>
<ol>
<li>Denial - Disregarding the possibility that your worldview might have inconsistencies or be invalid in any way.</li>
<li>Anger - Lashing out at anyone who proposes ideas that differ to yours.</li>
<li>Bargaining - Commonly found as whataboutism.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously these are just similarities, and don't necessarily reflect any type of process for dealing with living in an echo chamber.</p>

<p>As of this writing, there are only a few major players in the virtual reality market. The market itself is split between mobile solutions like the Gear VR by Samsung and head mounted display such as the Vive by HTC/Valve, which have to be paired with a top-of-the-line gaming pc. Google also joined the fray two years ago with their massively successful Cardboard project.</p>
<p>While details are still scarce about Daydream, it seems clear that it is the successor to Cardboard. Where Cardboard was simply an accessory that allows current smartphones to act as VR headsets, Daydream aims to guide the hardware specifications of new phones towards being more competent at VR. Google has partnered with eight manufacturers (Samsung, HTC, LG, Xiaomi, Huawei, ZTE, Asus, and Alcatel) who will incorporate Daydream specifications into new phones.</p>
<p>Daydream is open to developers to start playing with now, but it probably won't be until the release of Android N that we see some real momentum.</p>

<h1>Windows Anniversary Update</h1>
<p>Microsoft has done some crazy things with Windows 10 (most recently, acting like malware to force updates), but the Anniversary update is a step in the right direction. Included in this update are pen/finger drawing recognition, faster Cortana access, better two factor authentication with Windows Hello, and DirectX 12 for enhanced graphics capabilities. Though I'm sure the drawing recognition will be useful on a Surface, I have a hard time imagining someone drawing out a business graph with their finger and a trackpad. As for Cortana, you can now access her without logging in. Microsoft is continuing to push Windows Hello but, unless you have a compatible device such as the Lumia 950, iris scanning won't be of much benefit to you. Lastly is DirectX 12, the graphics driver update. DirectX are usually increments accompanied by increased hardware requirements but 12 is an exception. Unfortunately, it is seemingly tied to Windows 10, with no plans to backport it to Windows 8 or 7.</p>
<p>For now, the release date of this update is set for "later in 2016."</p>
<p><a id="org04ff5bd"></a></p>
<h1>Windows Holographic/HoloLens</h1>
<p>Microsoft announced that they are opening up their VR/mixed reality platform called "Windows Holographic." Do not confuse this with the HoloLens - though they share similar names, the HoloLens is a product and Holographic is a platform. Microsoft intends for partners and manufacturers to use this platform as a basis for new products. Subsequently, the HoloLens will be the flagship device for Holographic.</p>
<p><a id="orga91e328"></a></p>
<h1>AMD Releases RX 480; A VR ready graphics card for $200</h1>
<p>The RX 480 is AMD's first graphics card on the Polaris architecture. Polaris is purported to be manufactured with optimized FinFET technology, incorporates HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.3, and 4K h.265 encode/decode. In practice, what this means is that the 480 will be a significant jump in graphics performance from a midrange card. This particular announcement is quite astonishing, since their major competitor released one of their new graphics cards which seems to give less performance/$. As always, benchmarks will be the true test, but the 480 is shaping up to be the everyday man's GPU for VR. </p>
<p>Set to release June 29, 2016</p>
<p><a id="orgea766ed"></a></p>
<h1>AMD Zen architecture</h1>
<p>In the CPU market there really isn't much competition for desktop computers. Intel has been the top dog for the last few years with AMD trailing by a fair margin. With their new architecture "Zen" on the horizon though, the tide could turn. While the presenter only showed an engineering sample, it is nice to see Zen materialize at last. Zen is built with a new socket, AM4, which means it is not backwards compatible with older motherboards. Additionally, Zen will be used for AMD's APU lineup which could allow for some serious onboard graphics.</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether or not Zen will be retail-ready by the end of 2016.</p>
<p><a id="org46a5121"></a></p>
<h1>MSI VR Backpack</h1>
<p>One of the major hurdles of VR is immersion, and what better way to feel immersed than the ability to move freely. The MSI Backpack PC solves the wires issue, while developing more hurdles. At its core the Backpack PC is as simple as it's namesake, a VR ready computer built with straps and a battery. Some problems that the Backpack PC supposedly solves are cooling, upgradability, and external ports. Unfortunately the weight is a fair bit higher (12 lbs) than its competitor the Gigabyte Aorus X7 DT (7.6 lbs).</p>
<p>Hints say that the backpack might arrive at the end of 2016.</p>
<p><a id="org1d9a194"></a></p>
<h1>Wooting One Analog keyboard</h1>
<p>In terms of keyboards the Wooting One is anything but standard. Firstly, it is tenkeyless, which means it lacks a numpad, similar to a laptop layout. Secondly, it is mechanical, meaning each key is controlled by its very own switch as opposed to a singular membrane for the entirety of the board. Lastly, (and what makes this keyboard unique) is that instead of the switches having two states (up/down), these switches (Flaratech Optical Switches) have many states determined by an infrared emitter and light sensor. This allows for much more precision, and will be mostly useful in gaming as a substitute for a controller.</p>
<p>The Wooting One is on Kickstarter now for $155.</p>

<h1>Google I/O</h1>
<p>Google IO (Input/Output) is one of the major tech events that happen each year. 2016 marks the 10th anniversary of the presentation. While I expected more fanfare for the 10th (it certainly debuted with a high energy musical/video performance), it was a pleasure to see a somewhat relaxed and calmer keynote.</p>
<p>Some companies host events like this for the press, others have booths at consumer events, but Google's audience at IO consists of press, consumers, and a large selection of developers. Having development experience is not mandatory to attend any of the lectures, but it certainly helps when discussing the intricate details of new APIs or programs. Even though my main programming language is Python, I know enough Java to follow along with the developer talks. These talks are a boon of tips and tricks to using some to the new APIs.</p>
<p><a id="org7c6acbc"></a></p>
<h1>Google Home Assistant</h1>
<p>Presenting the Google Assistant was Mario Querioz. Even though Google Assistant is a software implementation, the main implementation is with a device named Google Home. I have to say that when introduced, my mind leapt to a comparison with the old Microsoft Clippy.</p>
<p>At the start of the segment Mr.Querioz alluded to other companies with similar products on the market. When revealed, it is obvious the Google Home device takes inspiration from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-WiFi-Alexa/dp/B00X4WHP5E">Amazon Echo</a>. The 'Home' features all the connectivity that you would expect, including most of the functionality inherent in a Chromecast. Much of the focus of this segment was on the improvements in Google's backend machine learning and AI.</p>
<p><a id="orga9dc64d"></a></p>
<h1>Allo &amp; Duo</h1>
<p>Allo and Duo are two new complementary communication services, where Allo is text-based and Duo is for video calling, presented by Erik Kay. Why Google decided to add yet another messaging app to their suite instead of fixing their current selection is beyond me. The question is whether anything  was revealed besides basic text and chat functionality that we have seen from their earlier offerings (Messenger, Hangouts). To be honest, I was quite surprised by their 'headline' feature which they are calling 'Whisper/Shout'. To put it simply, it is just font scaling. Smaller text for whispering and larger for shouting, chosen with a slider. The other features introduced were much more interesting to me. Allo will be fully integrated with Google Assistant, including machine learning for picture recognition and smart reply. Finally, Allo will allow for 'Incognito' chat, enabling End-to-End encryption.</p>
<p>Duo is the video application counterpart to Allo. Duo includes many of the features of Allo, such as End-to-End encryption. With Facebook video calling, Skype, and FaceTime crowding the market, it is interesting to see how Google is trying to differentiate Duo. Duo takes hints from its competitors, such as cross-platform availability from Skype and Facebook and phone number based identification from FaceTime.</p>

<h1>Android N(anaimo Bar)</h1>
<p>There are always so many new features in Android updates that it becomes hard to summarize all of the changes properly. The major areas of innovation are in Visual Layouts and Virtual Reality. In terms of layouts, N brings multitasking to a new level with split screen multi-windows. It also introduces Picture-in-Picture mode for Android TV, which apparently is not useful for tablets or phones.  Finally, Google has announced <a href="google-daydream.html">'Daydream'</a>, explained by Clay Bevor as a new platform for VR. The platform includes detailed specifications for software, new phone hardware, and a physical headset. What I found of particular interest was the inclusion of a headband, which has been a topic of debate for previous Google VR implementations (Cardboard).</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Overall it was a keynote filled with some novel ideas, fake excitement, and a whole lot of 'pass the buck.' What was the star of Google IO so far? Undoubtedly the machine learning and AI teams behind all of the interesting tech. I look forward to writing about the rest of IO and hope there are more juicy tech stories to come.</p>
